Advantages:
* Phenothiazines show a large spectrum of activity against both fungi and amoeba (including those that cause some NTD's) 
* Extremely low cost to produce (1 kilo of phenothiazine is less than 100 usd from SA)
* Suspected multiple mechanisms of action including calmodulin and lipid synthesis disruption makes resistance hard to acheive (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.7b00157 and https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article/53/8/890/982579 )
* Phenothiazines have a small but important role in emergency medicine world wide even to this day
* Lipophilic to penetrate into fungal grain 
* Apparently long lasting in vivo (30h t1/2 for chlorpromazine 21h t1/2 for thioridazine 17h t1/2 for promethazine) 
* Chlorpromazine has been used in clinical experiments as an adjuvant for treating some fungal and ameobic infections

Disadvantages:
* Some phenothiazines are photosensitive and some may cause a tetracycline like photosensitivity in vivo
* High lipophilicity might cause ADMET problems 
* Agranulocytosis is rare side effect reported from long term use of certain phenothiazines
