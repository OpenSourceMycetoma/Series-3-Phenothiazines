<h1>Series 3: A tricyclic antifungal drug devlopment project</h1>

Advantages:
* Tricyclic class drugs show a large spectrum of activity against both fungi and amoeba (including those that cause some NTD's) 
* Extremely low cost and straightforward to produce (only 2 or 3 steps from common materials) (1 kilo of phenothiazine is less than 100 usd from SA)
* Suspected multiple mechanisms of action including calmodulin and lipid synthesis disruption makes resistance unlikely ( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.7b00157 and https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article/53/8/890/982579 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815111/ )
* Lipophilic to penetrate into fungal grain 
* t½ varies quite a bit but is generally long (e.g 30h t½ for chlorpromazine  and ~10h t½ for trifluoperazine) 
* This class of drugs has been used in clinical antimicrobial experiments a handful of times: (E.G https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(83)91769-5 and https://doi.org/10.1086/379020 )

Disadvantages:
* Some tricyclic drugs may cause a tetracycline-like photosensitivity in vivo (We will need to research this more)
* Water solubility is very variable 
* Myelosuppression is a rare side effect reported from long term use from some but not all drugs in this class (We will need to research this more)
* Some tricyclic class drugs come with some with some rather unpleasant side-effects
