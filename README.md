Advantages:
* Phenothiazines show a large spectrum of activity against both fungi and amoeba (including those that cause some NTD's) 
* Extremely low cost and straightforward to produce (only 2 or 3 steps from common starting material) (1 kilo of phenothiazine is less than 100 usd from SA)
* Suspected multiple mechanisms of action including calmodulin and lipid synthesis disruption makes resistance unlikely ( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.7b00157 and https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article/53/8/890/982579 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815111/ )
* Lipophilic to penetrate into fungal grain 
* Long lasting in vivo (30h t1/2 for chlorpromazine 21h t1/2 for thioridazine 17h t1/2 for promethazine) 
* Chlorpromazine has been used in clinical antimicrobial experiments a handful of times: (E.G https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(83)91769-5 )

Disadvantages:
* Phenothiazines are photosensitive and some may cause a tetracycline-like photosensitivity in vivo - they also must be stored in the dark (however, other tricyclics do NOT seem as photosenstive)
* Water solubility is not great by any means
* Agranulocytosis is rare side effect reported from long term use from some but not all tricylic drugs (We will need to research this more)
* Since parent drugs are neurological ones with some rather unpleasant side-effects - We will need to select for compounds with limited BBB entry!
